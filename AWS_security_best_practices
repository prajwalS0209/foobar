🔐 Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for all users, especially root.

Avoid using the root account—create individual IAM users with least privilege.

Apply the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)—grant only the permissions needed.

Use IAM roles instead of embedding credentials in apps (e.g., for EC2, Lambda).

Rotate credentials regularly—use AWS Secrets Manager for managing secrets.

🔒 Data Protection
Encrypt data at rest and in transit using AWS services (e.g., S3, EBS, RDS with KMS).

Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys securely.

Enable S3 bucket encryption and block public access unless required.

🛡️ Network Security
Use Security Groups and NACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic.

Restrict public access to EC2 instances and S3 buckets.

Use VPC Flow Logs to monitor traffic and identify anomalies.

Deploy workloads in private subnets when possible.

Use AWS Shield and WAF to protect against DDoS and web attacks.

🔍 Monitoring & Logging
Enable CloudTrail in all regions to log all account activity.

Use CloudWatch for alarms and logs to detect abnormal activity.

Set up AWS Config to track configuration changes and compliance.

🔄 Compliance and Governance
Use AWS Organizations and SCPs (Service Control Policies) to enforce policies across accounts.

Enable GuardDuty for intelligent threat detection.

Use Inspector / Security Hub to scan for vulnerabilities and view findings in one place.

🧪 Operational Practices
Regularly audit permissions and IAM policies.

Apply security patches promptly on EC2 instances and containers.

Back up data regularly using services like AWS Backup or versioning in S3.
